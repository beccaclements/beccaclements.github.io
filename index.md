I am a senior at the University of Delaware majoring in biomedical engineering. 

At the [Mechanical Neuroimaging Lab](https://sites.udel.edu/johnsonlab/) at UD, I have conducted research on magnetic resonance elastography (MRE) and am pursuing a senior thesis project on brain age estimation using artificial neural networks and MRE. I also participated in the "Neurotechnologies to Help the Body Move, Heal, and Feel Again" REU at the University of Houston, where I conducted research on 3D brain visualization at the [Scalable Tissue Imaging and Modeling Lab](https://stim.ee.uh.edu/).
